It was a straightforward game, but I was struggling :sob:. Apologies for the insanely late turn-in; I had a lot going on. 
 
Butterfly NPC: killing a butterfly reduces the health of the player

Spider: killing a spider increases the player's score by 100

If three butterflies are killed, a game-over occurs.
